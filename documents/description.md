# Project description and plan

This project serves a group of people who share a set of spaces and need to use the spaces at various times. Examples include kitchens, lab spaces, and study room. This language would be good for any user to reserve a space or designate the space as 'occupied'. The project involves three main components, an intermediate representation, a front-end and a back-end. The plan is to develop in that order as well. The intermediate representation will take the front-end language and convert it into object relations for the back-end. The front-end will be the outer language for users to interact with space and event management. The back-end will hold the persistent objects and information about rooms.

## Motivation

This project is interesting to me because it solves one of my frustrations at Harvey Mudd. When I try to organize events, I find it frustrating to check multiple dates and times or try to do multiple reservations. A DSL is an appropriate solution because the management system needs to be intuitive so that any user will be able to use the system without burdensome training.

## Language domain

The domain of this project is the event management domain.
