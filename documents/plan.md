# Project plan

## Language evaluation

This language will accomplish its goals if other users find it easier to view schedules and book rooms using this language than using the current event management system for Mudd. I will be using functionality as the primary metric, "Can it do what I expect an EMS to be able to do?", and ease-of-use as a the second metric "How hard is it to do what I expect it to be able to do?". A tertiary metric could be how quickly new users can check the availability of a room and then book it. I will be sure to incorporate new critiques of the implmentations into the following week's changes to ensure that the implmentation is of high quality.

## Implementation plan

Choosing a language:
The focus of this project should be what is listed under week 1, 2 and 4 since those are the most "language-y" parts of this project. A back-end would be neat, but I think this schedule will be a basic outline. In the case that parts take longer, the front-end and intermediate representation will be prioritized.

Week 1: Selecting a language, basic Intermediate Representation, and locally stored

Week 2: Front-end/API, hopefully something that is functional(!)

Week 3: Back-end/OR mapper (maybe, could swap with week 4)

Week 4: Feature additions to IR/API

Week 5: Error handling?
