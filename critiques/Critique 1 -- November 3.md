Note: I'll group some of my critiques by the section of the project plan/description that I'm responding to.

## Language evaluation

How do you plan to weigh the three proposed metrics in terms of importance? I would suggest using ease-of-use as the primary metric - 
I think that a smaller DSL which is easier to use is better than a big one with a bad UX.

## Implementation plan

What do you mean when you say that a back-end would be neat? You seem to imply that a back-end isn't necessary 
for the project to be complete. By back-end do you mean something different from the semantics of the language? If not,
I'd argue that having **some** back-end is essential to having a finished product. 

Also, I like your implementation plan! I think error handling would be a good thing to spend time on, it'll give 
the language a more polished feel.
